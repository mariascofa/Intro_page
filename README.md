# Flask

# Installation

2.source venv/bin/activate
3.sudo pip3 install Flask

in the application (main.py):

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
app.run(debug=True, port=5002)

"""
Best server run app.run (debug = True)

# SQLite
SQLite is relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in a C library. 
In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine.

-sudo apt install sqlite3

in the application (main.py):
import sqlite3

# Steps with commands for creating table "NAMES":
1.source venv/bin/activate
2.sqlite3 names
3.CREATE TABLE NAMES(ID integer primary key autoincrement, Name varchar(200));

(varchar is a data type similar to text, the only difference is that
the text takes up about is designed for large volumes of text and takes
a lot of space in the database, but if you know that the data in the column will be
not very large for example Name, then you can use varchar
indicating the maximum column size, in this example 200)
